You must have the following to install PCF on GCP:

#### Sufficient Quota for GCP Resources ####

You must have a GCP project with sufficient quota to deploy all resources needed for a PCF installation. In GCP, quotas enforce limits on the allocation of resources to a project. GCP applies quotas on a region and global level. By default, most GCP projects have more than adequate quota allocation; however, if you do additional quota, you can request a quota increase on the [GCP Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/quotas).

The following table provides minimum quota requirements estimates of the GCP resources required by PCF. 

| Service | Resource | Estimated # Per PCF Foundation (1 AZ) | EStimated # Per PCF Foundation (3 AZs) | Recommended Minimum |
---------- 
| Google Compute Engine |  Static IP addresses | | |
| Google Compute Engine Networks |
| Subnetworks |
| Firewall rules |
| Routes?







* Sufficiently high instance limits, or no instance limits, on your GCP account. Installing PCF requires at least 10 concurrent instances for testing or development deployments and typically at least 30 for production deployments. The exact number of instances depends on the number of tiles and availability zones you plan to deploy. 

A minimal single-AZ GCP deployment requires the following 20 `custom` VMs:

<tr><th>VM Count</th><th>Machine type</th><th>Memory (in GB)</th> </tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>1vCPU</td><td>1.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1vCPU</td><td>6.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1vCPU</td><td>2.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2vCPU</td><td>4.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>2vCPU</td><td>8.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>4vCPU</td><td>16.00</td></tr>

* <a name="#env_account"></a>A GCP account with adequate permissions to create resources within the selected GCP project. Per the [Least Privileged User principle](./iaas-user-roles.html), the permissions required to set up a GCP environment for PCF include:
   * Permissions to create firewalls, networks, load balancers, and other resources:
     * **Compute Engine** > **Compute Instances Admin (beta)**
     * **Compute Engine** > **Compute Network Admin**
     * **Compute Engine** > **Compute Security Admin**
   * If using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for Cloud Controller filestorage, permissions to create buckets:
     * **Storage** > **Storage Admin**
   * If you are using Cloud DNS, permissions to add and modify DNS entries:
     * **Project** > **Editor**

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you deploy PCF, the deployment processes run under a [separate service account](./gcp-prepare-env.html#iam_account) with the minimum permissions required to install Ops Manager and ERT. 

* The [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) installed on your machine and authenticated to your GCP account.

* Administrative rights to a domain for your PCF installation. You need to be able to add wildcard records to this domain. You specify this registered domain when configuring the SSL certificate and Cloud Controller for your deployment. For more information see the [Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point](../opsguide/security_config.html) topic. </td>
* An SSL certificate for your PCF domain. This can be a self-signed certificate, which Ops Manager can generate for you, but Pivotal recommends using a self-signed certificate for development and testing purposes only. If you plan to deploy PCF into a production environment, you must obtain a certificate from your Certificate Authority.
